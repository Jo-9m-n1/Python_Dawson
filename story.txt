In a quiet town, there was a clock shop called "Tick Tock Treasures," run by an old man named Mr. Percival. His clocks were perfect, but one was special—a glowing clock called the Clock of Lost Time.

One evening, a curious girl named Lila asked about the clock. Mr. Percival explained, "This clock shows you forgotten moments—times you’ve missed or regret. But be careful, it only lets you see, not change."

Lila, intrigued, touched the clock. In an instant, she found herself reliving a moment from her past—a forgotten day spent laughing with her younger brother. She watched, unable to change anything, but for a brief moment, she felt the warmth of what was lost.

The clock ticked again, and the memory faded, leaving her with a bittersweet reminder that some moments are gone forever.
