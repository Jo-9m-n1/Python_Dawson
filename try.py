1) Count the numeber of words in your file.

2) Make two files: cats.txt and dogs.txt. Store at least three names of cats in the first
   file and three names of dogs in the second file. Write a program that tries to read these
   files and print the contents of the file to the screen. Wrap your code in a try-excpet block
   to catch the FileNotFoundError and print a friendly message if a file is missing. Move one of the
   files to a different location on your system and make sure that the code in the except block
   executes proper.

3) Modify your previous code to fail silently if either file is missing.

4) One common problem when promting for numerical inputs occurs when providing text instead of numbers.
   In such a case, when trying to convert the input to int, a ValueError occurs. Write a program that prompts
   the user for two numbers, add them together and print the result. Catch the ValueError if either input 
   value is not a number and print a friendly error message. Test your program by enetering 
   two numbers and then by entering some text instead of a number.
